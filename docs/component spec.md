Simulation Manager: Responsible for the dynamic simulation of signaling pathways using the ODE solver from SciPy, which performs numerical integration for time-course analyses.

Visualization Manager: Generates intuitive reaction network diagrams and concentration change curves, allowing users to visually analyze molecular interactions and dynamic changes over time.

Component Interaction: Users initiate pathway analysis by importing model data through the Data Manager. The Simulation Manager then performs the simulation based on user-defined parameters, producing time-series data. Finally, the Visualization Manager displays results, including reaction networks and concentration changes, allowing users to explore the pathway dynamics and gain insights into system behavior.

Project Plan: 

Phase 1 - Initial Setup and Integration: Implement basic data import/export features, initial ODE-based simulation capability, and basic visualization templates. 

Phase 2 - Feature Expansion and Optimization: Enhance simulation customization, improve data management for larger networks, and develop advanced visualization options. 

Phase 3 - Deployment and Documentation: Finalize the tool for deployment, ensuring comprehensive user documentation and tutorials for accessibility.
