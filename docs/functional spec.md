Users need a tool to identify key nodes within signaling pathways and evaluate how dynamic changes in these pathways impact cellular behavior and system stability.
This tool addresses a critical need in systems biology, where understanding signaling dynamics can aid in drug discovery, uncover disease mechanisms, and predict cellular responses to various stimuli.

Problem Importance: Signal transduction pathways control many essential cellular processes, such as growth, division, and apoptosis. Dysregulation of these pathways often leads to diseases like cancer and autoimmune disorders. A robust simulation tool helps researchers predict how perturbations in signaling pathways influence biological outcomes. Current tools often lack an intuitive interface for both data import/export and dynamic visualization, making it challenging for researchers to iteratively test hypotheses and interpret results effectively.

Use Cases: Users build and simulate reaction networks involving multiple signaling molecules to study system behavior under different initial conditions.
Users visualize the reaction network structure and time-dependent molecular behavior, gaining insights into system stability and identifying possible therapeutic targets.
